## Task 1: Setup

The setup for this project is different from all other assignments so far. **Read this carefully and do not skip any steps!**

{: .danger}
> You need to accept your Github repo invite **within a week** of it being sent, or else it will expire, and you will not be able to work on the project.
> 
> If this happens to you, please make a *private Ed post* under **Question > Projects > Proj 3 > Logistics (Private)**. You should see an autogenerated template appear.

1. Go to your email and accept the Github repo invite.

2. Log in to Beacon, and click on the "Groups" tab. You should have a group listed here.

3. Click the "View Repository on GitHub" link.

4. Click "SSH" and copy the link that appears. It should look like this, with `***` replaced with some group number:

    `git@github.com:Berkeley-CS61B-Student/{{ site.semester }}-proj3-g***.git`

5. Open a new terminal window in your local computer.

6. Use `cd` to navigate to your CS 61B folder. Most students have a folder called `cs61b`.

    Warning: Do not navigate to your personal `{{ site.semester }}-s***` repo! You should not be cloning your group repo inside your personal one.

7. Type `pwd` in your terminal. This will output the current directory you are in.

    Make sure you do not see `{{ site.semester }}-s***` in the output! If you do, go back to Step 6.

    <img alt="pwd should not display your fa24-s*** personal repo." src="../assets/proj3-setup/8-pwd.png">

8. In your terminal, clone your repo, replacing the URL with the one you copied earlier:

    `git clone git@github.com:Berkeley-CS61B-Student/{{ site.semester }}-proj3-g***.git`

9. Navigate into the repo you just cloned:

    `cd {{ site.semester }}-proj3-g***`

10. Tell Github where to find the skeleton repo:

    `git remote add skeleton https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/proj3-skeleton-{{ site.semester }}.git`

11. Pull the skeleton code:

    `git pull skeleton main --allow-unrelated-histories`

Once you’ve completed the above steps, you should see your new group repo called `{{ site.semester }}-proj3-g***` in your local files, and if you open this repo, you’ll see the `proj3` skeleton folder. From here, you and your partner can proceed as normal, by adding, committing, pushing, and pulling from this repo as you would otherwise.
