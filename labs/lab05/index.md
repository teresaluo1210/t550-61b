## FAQ Page

Please use our **[common issues and frequently asked questions page](./faq.md)**
as a resource. We'll be updating this FAQ page on the website throughout the
week!

## Introduction

In this lab, you will compare your solution to Project 1 with 1-3 other students in your lab. **On-time attendance is required this week**. If you cannot attend your regular lab, you may attend any other lab instead, barring room capacity.

If you are physically unable to attend any lab at all, please fill out **[this exemption form](https://forms.gle/eQqWjZn4hbHkQAXj8) by Friday, February 28th (2/28)**. **If you have approved extensions for Project 1A/1B that extend past the Lab 5 deadline, please also fill out the form. Do NOT fill out the form unless you have approved extensions.** We will be verifying each form submission manually, and those with invalid submissions will not be checked off. **We will not be accepting any new form submissions after 2/28**, and will be emailing checkoff instructions during the weekend of March 1st (3/1).

{: .warning}
As part of this lab, TAs will go over part of the solution for Project 1. **Do not attend this lab before you have made your final Project 1A and 1B submission to Gradescope, otherwise you will get marked for academic dishonesty.**

Please find the Lab 5 FAQ [here](./faq.md). **This lab is due Friday, February 28**. Good luck!

## Skeleton

Please run `git pull skeleton main` in order to receive the `lab05` starter files. Make sure your current changes are committed and pushed before pulling!

## LinkedListDeque61B Overview

Your TA will start the lab by giving a brief overview of the staff solution to `LinkedListDeque61B`.

### LinkedListDeque61B Peer Review

Group up with 1-3 other students and compare solutions. You should form groups with other students in Discord rooms. Don't be afraid of meeting someone new! Programmers in 61B vary widely in their level of experience and comfort with programming. Our goal here is to help each other get better. Please be nice, and don't feel bad if your solution is less elegant or even downright ugly. I've certainly written incredibly ugly, inelegant code! Why here's [a 1600 line monstrosity I wrote in 1997](knaveos.html), and a [video demo of it running](https://youtu.be/XgJUC0Le_Ew) if you're curious what it does. knaveos will not be on any exam.

Avoid the temptation to explain exactly how your implementation works to your partner. Instead focus your discussion on more specific questions. Some suggested questions are listed below:

1. What was the most annoying bug you had and how did you fix it? Did you use the debugger? Did you fix it by adding special cases? Did you do any change-and-pray (where you make a tiny change and hope the AG approves)?
2. Did you end up cutting anything out to make your code simpler? If so, what?
3. Do you have any special cases in your code?
4. Do you have any private helper methods?
5. Does your code repeat itself anywhere? Would private helper methods have helped?
6. Were you able to call or reuse code anywhere?

After discussion, fill out `self_reflection.txt` with your own self reflection.

## ArrayDeque61B Overview

Your TA will go over the `ArrayDeque61B` solution.

### ArrayDeque61B Peer Review

Now, pair up again and discuss your `ArrayDeque61B` solutions as you did for `LinkedListDeque61B`. Fill out your `self_reflection.txt`. We recommend that you talk to different people than you did for `ArrayDeque61B`, but it's OK to stick with your group for `ArrayDeque61B`.

## Self Reflection and Submission

Make sure you've filled out at least 4 of the questions for both `ArrayDeque61B` and `LinkedListDeque61B` in the `self_reflection.txt` document provided in the skeleton. You should answer a minimum of 8 questions in total. Ask a TA to check your `self_reflection.txt` and give you the magic word to put in `magic_word.txt`. Push to Github and submit to Gradescope.
